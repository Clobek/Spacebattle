            <h1>Story</h1>
            <p>You awake from a morning nap to people shouting just outside your sleeping quarters. After speaking to a few people you find out that a large fleet of aliens are converging on your location. News had spread fast and the rest of the crew is beginning to panic. Even your lousy captain managed to jump ship in one of the few working space pods. Now is your time to shine... years of janitorial work at the international space station has left you callous and an expert at handling "messy" situations.</p>

            <h1>How To Play</h1>
            <p>Getting Started -You start the game by clicking on the "change ship name" button. This allows you to then click the "start/restart" button.<br></br>Health - You start the game with 20 health, the concept is simple... if you reach 0 health you lose. If the enemy reaches 0 health, you get rewarded.<br></br>Power - Power is how much damage you do to the enemy if you manage to hit them.<br></br>Accuracy - Your chances of successfully hitting the enemy. When you miss you do 0 damage.<br></br>Stage - Each stage presents 5 aliens to defeat. Enemies grow stronger every stage and the rewards greater. Between each stage your crew has a chance to repair the ship at no charge so don't worry about making sure to heal if you've already completed the stage.<br></br>Score - A set of points that you get for defeating each alien. The higher the stage the more points you get per alien.<br></br>Money - Like score once you defeat an enemy you scavenge what's left of the enemies ship and sell the parts. You can use your money to upgrade or repair your ship.<br></br>Command Log - A display of both you and your enemies actions as well as the results. A good place to see how much money you're scavenging or if you might need to increase your accuracy.</p>
